# MaximalCliques
__PHP Library to resolve Maximal Cliques in undirected graph__

A clique of a graph G is a complete subgraph of G.
A maximal clique is a clique that cannot be extended by including one more adjacent vertex, meaning it is not a subset
of a larger clique


This implementation of Bronâ€“Kerbosch's algorithm include three methods:

- Basic resolution (obtainCompleteGraphsWithoutPivoting)
- Pivoting resolution (obtainCompleteGraphsWithPivoting)
- Vertex ordering resolution (obtainCompleteGraphsWithVertexOrdering)

And three methods based on "obtainCompleteGraphsWithVertexOrdering" for advancing search and less time of resolution:
- Only cliques that include a specific vertex (obtainCompleteGraphsWithVertexOrderingForVertex)
- Only cliques whose degree is equal to or greater than the specified (obtainCompleteGraphsWithVertexOrderingWithMinimumDegree)
- Only cliques that include a specific vertex and whose degree is equal to or greater than the specified (obtainCompleteGraphsWithVertexOrderingForVertexWithMinimumDegree)

Finally, a function is included to collect the clique larger than those generated with one of the previous six functions.
- (retrieveMaximalClique)

The six implementations return a array of maximal cliques each represented in an array of vertex, "retrieveMaximalClique" returns a array of vertex.

For a graph G whit 6 nodes:
```
6 - 4 - 5 - 1
    |   |  /
    |   | /
    |   |/
    3 - 2
```
This will be composed of five maximal cliques:
```
[
    [1,2,5],
    [2,3],
    [3,4],
    [4,5],
    [4,6]
]
```

## Installation

for php 5.3 or lower use:  
composer require "skilla/maximal-cliques:0.1.*"  

for php 5.4 or higher  
composer require "skilla/maximal-cliques:dev-master"  


## How to use
The source code includes "DataTransformerExample" class that implements the "DataTransformerInterface" interface. The purpose of this is to serve as a test and example.  
Copy this class and adapt their methods to be able to process the data as generated in your application.  
Then follow any of the examples used to test the class in "test / BronKerboschAlgorithmsTest.php"
